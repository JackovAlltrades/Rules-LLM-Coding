# Automated setup script for integrating Master List Rules into a new project (Bash).
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# Clones/syncs the MLR repository, installs dependencies (optional),
# configures the project environment, and sets up CI/CD workflows based on the
# MLR system. Designed for Linux/macOS environments.
#
# NOTES:
# Run this script from the root directory of the *target project* where you want
# to integrate the MLR system. Requires sudo privileges for installing tools.
# Review the script before execution.

# --- Define Variables (Customize if needed) ---
MASTER_REPO_URL="https://github.com/JackovAlltrades/Rules-LLM-Coding.git" # The central MLR repo
MLR_LOCAL_CLONE_PATH="./mlr_repo_cache" # Temporary clone location within project
TARGET_PROJECT_PATH="."

echo "Master List Rules - Automated Project Setup (Bash)"
echo "Target Project Path: \C:\temp"
echo "======================================================="

# Exit on error
set -e

# --- Step 1: Check Prerequisites ---
echo "[1/6] Checking prerequisites..."
# Check sudo privileges (Needed for potential installs)
# ... (Implementation needed)

# Check if Git is installed
# ... (Implementation needed)

# Check for optional tools (node, python3, docker) and package manager (apt, dnf, brew)
# ... (Implementation needed). Ask user if they want to install.

echo "Prerequisites check complete."

# --- Step 2: Clone/Update Master Repository ---
echo "[2/6] Cloning/Updating Master Rules Repository..."
# Clone \ to \ or pull if exists
# ... (Implementation needed using git clone/pull)

echo "Master Rules Repository synced."

# --- Step 3: Sync Core MLR Assets ---
echo "[3/6] Syncing core MLR assets..."
# Use rsync to safely copy rules/, checklists/, templates/, configs/
# from \ to \
# ... (Implementation needed - careful not to overwrite user changes on updates)

echo "Core assets synced."

# --- Step 4: Install Dependencies (Optional) ---
echo "[4/6] Installing dependencies (if requested)..."
# If user consented in Step 1, attempt installation using detected package manager
# ... (Implementation needed)

echo "Dependency installation step complete."

# --- Step 5: Configure Environment ---
echo "[5/6] Configuring environment..."
# Setup .env files, or specific configurations needed by the project/tools
# ... (Implementation needed, consider using .env files)

echo "Environment configuration complete."

# --- Step 6: Deploy CI/CD Workflows ---
echo "[6/6] Deploying CI/CD workflows..."
# Copy workflow files from \/workflows to .github/workflows (or other targets)
# Check if target exists first, maybe copy as .template if conflicts
# ... (Implementation needed)

echo "CI/CD workflow deployment complete."
echo "======================================================="
echo "Setup finished successfully!"
echo "Review any messages above for manual steps or warnings."

**8. DevOps & Infrastructure**

*   **8.1. Version Control (Git):**
    *   8.1.1. **Meaningful Commits:** Write clear, concise commit messages explaining the change.
    *   8.1.2. **Branching Strategy:** Follow a consistent branching model (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow). Use Pull/Merge Requests for code review.
    *   8.1.3. **`.gitignore`:** Keep repository clean by ignoring build artifacts, logs, dependencies, and secrets.

*   **8.2. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery):**
    *   8.2.1. **Automated Builds:** Trigger builds automatically on code commits.
    *   8.2.2. **Automated Testing:** Run unit, integration, and potentially other tests automatically in the pipeline. Fail the build on test failures.
    *   8.2.3. **Automated Deployment:** Automate deployment to staging/production environments after successful builds/tests. Implement rollback strategies.
    *   8.2.4. **Security Scanning:** Integrate SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **8.3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   8.3.1. **Manage Infrastructure with Code:** Use tools like Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CDK, or ARM/Bicep templates to define and manage infrastructure resources.
    *   8.3.2. **Version Control IaC:** Store IaC definitions in version control. Apply changes through review and CI/CD processes.

*   **8.4. Monitoring & Observability:**
    *   8.4.1. **Metrics:** Collect key application and system metrics (request rates, error rates, latency, resource utilization). Use tools like Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic.
    *   8.4.2. **Logging:** Centralize application and infrastructure logs for analysis and debugging (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Loki). Correlate logs with traces.
    *   8.4.3. **Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing to track requests across multiple services (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry).
    *   8.4.4. **Alerting:** Set up alerts based on key metrics and log patterns to proactively identify issues.

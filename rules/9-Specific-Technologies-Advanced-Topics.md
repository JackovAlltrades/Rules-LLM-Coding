**9. Specific Technologies & Advanced Topics**

*   **9.1. Database Specifics:**
    *   9.1.1. **Understand DB Engine:** Leverage features specific to the chosen database (e.g., JSONB in Postgres, materialized views, specific indexing types).
    *   9.1.2. **Migration Management:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic, Flyway, `migrate`) to manage schema changes version control.

*   **9.2. Containerization & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes):**
    *   9.2.1. **Efficient Dockerfiles:** Write multi-stage, optimized Dockerfiles. Minimize image size. Run containers as non-root users.
    *   9.2.2. **Kubernetes Best Practices:** Define proper resource requests/limits, health probes (liveness, readiness), configurations (ConfigMaps, Secrets), and deployment strategies (RollingUpdate, Canary). Understand networking and service discovery.

*   **9.3. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) & AI Integration:** *(Added Scope Note)* This section provides high-level guidance relevant when *building* AI/ML capabilities into applications, distinct from using LLMs for developer assistance (Section 1).
    *   9.3.1. **Reproducibility:** Track data, code, parameters, and environments used for model training.
    *   9.3.2. **Model Versioning:** Version trained models alongside code.
    *   9.3.3. **Automated Training/Deployment:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for ML models (training, evaluation, deployment).
    *   9.3.4. **Model Monitoring:** Monitor model performance (accuracy, drift, bias) and operational metrics (latency, resource usage) in production.
    *   9.3.5. **Data Validation & Management:** Implement robust data validation pipelines. Manage data lineage.
    *   9.3.6. **Feature Stores:** Consider using feature stores for managing ML features consistently across training and serving.
    *   9.3.7. **Ethical AI Considerations:** Actively test models for bias and fairness. Ensure transparency and explainability where appropriate.

*   **9.4. Serverless Computing:**
    *   9.4.1. **Understand Constraints:** Be aware of execution time limits, cold starts, state management challenges, and vendor lock-in potential.
    *   9.4.2. **Optimize for Short Execution:** Design functions to be focused and execute quickly.
    *   9.4.3. **Manage State Externally:** Use external databases, caches, or state management services.

*   **9.5. WebSockets & Real-time Communication:**
    *   9.5.1. **Connection Management:** Handle connection lifecycles, reconnections, and scaling challenges.
    *   9.5.2. **Security:** Authenticate and authorize WebSocket connections. Validate messages. Protect against DoS.

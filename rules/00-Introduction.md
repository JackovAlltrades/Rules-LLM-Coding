**Added Note:** This version (1.0.7) incorporates refinements based on the initial review feedback. It adds nuance to absolute standards, makes abstract rules more concrete, clarifies scope distinctions, incorporates previously missing topics (tool selection, training, feedback loops), and ensures terminology consistency. It builds upon the structure of v1.0.6.
